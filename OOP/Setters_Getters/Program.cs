/* Setters & Getters Comparison:
 * - No Setters: Properties are read-only. You can only
 *set their values through the constructor or 
 *internally in the class, and they cannot be changed
 *externally.
* - Private Setters: Properties are read-write, but 
the setter is private, meaning the value can only
be modified within the class, not externally.
* - Public Setters: Properties are read-write, 
* and both the getter and setter are accessible
* from outside the class.
